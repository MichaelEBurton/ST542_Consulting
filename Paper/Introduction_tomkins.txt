Introduction 
Co2 mitigation
Experimental design
Potential improvemnts
Background on chemistry involved
Challenges with design of experiment
Measurement error
Human error
Variation in wells among plate (not sure what happening here)
Many blocking levels, day, user, plate, well? 
What we are analyzing, difference between sample and control within wells, looking at time measurement within color changes to tell the activity of an enzyme.
Not sure how to manage all of these variables
Need to understand the chemical interactions better, and all of the mixture that goes into one well 
Same enzyme per plate? 
Sources of variability, how to limit errors as much as possible
What the experiment process looks like
What methods we will aim to use, or what the end goal is - recognizing enzyme activity and finding out if it is significant or now
