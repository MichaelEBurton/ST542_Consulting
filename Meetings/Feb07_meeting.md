# Meeting Notes

This meeting we primarily got to watch our clients carry out the assay which they wish to evaluate. Some things worth noting came up:
+ It takes around 2-3 hours to carry out the experiment for one plate
  - Half an hour for carbonating water
  - Half an hour to get machine to proper temperature
  - Half an hour for Chemical Preparation
  - Half and hour to let plate warm up
  - Half an hour to analyze plate
+ It appears that enzymes are less active towards the end of the experiment
  - This is caused by the control "speeding up" 
  - Activity is calculated as the inverse of time of enzyme - the inverse of time of the control
  - The researchers have a hard time believing the enzyme is less active towards the end
  
  ## Before the next meeting
  We need to perform some analysis to show them?
