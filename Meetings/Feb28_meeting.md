# February 28th Meeting

The main idea is to compare "new to the world enzymes" to each other and offer ways to "stress test" them. *Unfortunately* as the experiment goes on the controls speed up, which causes the enzyme activity appear to slow down over time. This is likely not the true case since the enzymes appear to have very stable results.

Our researchers would like our help in showing this assay can be used and to account for this downward trend in activity.

* There is no "statistical magic" that can correct for this downward trend?
* Maybe we can perform an experiment to try and identify why the control time is speeding up?
